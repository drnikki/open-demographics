The Question

      Do you identify as a person with a disability? For the purpose of this survey we define disability as a long-term physical, mental,       intellectual or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various attitudinal and environmental barriers, hinders your full and       effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

Questions this can help you answer
.......................................
While the raw data from this question can tell you how many of your community members have a disability, the data from this question can also act as a sign that your community needs to be more inclusive.  If your community holds in-person events but doesn't include any accommodations for people with disabilities, the data from this question can help you decide where to focus your resources first.  However, just because you don't have survey respondents saying that they (for example) have a hearing impairment, doesn't mean those community members don't exist and that you shouldn't make accomodations.

Ethical concerns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identifiable
.......................................
In many communities, the combination of disability and another metric (like gender or location) may be enough to identify the respondant.


Ethical Considerations
.......................................
- Many disabilities are not visible and this question is a challenge to people who choose to keep their disabilit[ies] private.
- It can be risky to reveal one's disability status online, and safety is also a concern for respondents. See :cite:`bowker_dicing_2003`: for more information
