### Guiding questions
.......................................
1. Should we ask race, ethnicity, culture, and/or nationality?
2. What _questions_ does asking about this information _answer_
3. What are the concerns with including each?
4. What are the concerns with not including it?

.. note::

   This isn't comprehensive, but a starting point to think critically about how to ask this question.
